#1 Define a list called 'products'

products = ["t-shirt", "mug", "hat", "book", "keychain"]


#2 Create an empty dictionary called 'inventory'

inventory = {}


#3 Ask the user to input the quantity of each product available in the inventory

for product in products:
    quantity = int(input(f"Enter the quantity for {product}: "))
    inventory[product] = quantity


print(inventory)


#4 Create an empty set called 'customer_orders'

customer_orders = set()


#5 Ask the user to input the name of three products that a customer wants to order

for i in range(3):

#6 Print the products

print("Customer Orders:", customer_orders)


#7-8 Calculate and print statistics

total_products_ordered = len(customer_orders)

percentage_ordered = (total_products_ordered / len(products)) * 100
print(percentage_ordered)

#9-10 Update and print the updated inventory

for product in customer_orders:
